# 🌤️ Cox Automotive: PollenGuard

**PollenGuard** is a data-driven decision support tool that helps automotive fleet operators optimize vehicle wash scheduling based on real-time air quality and pollen conditions. Built with Streamlit and powered by live environmental data and AI-generated explanations, PollenGuard reduces unnecessary washes, saves water, and improves fleet presentation efficiency.

---

## 🚗 Problem
Fleet operators frequently wash vehicles on fixed schedules, even when high pollen or poor air quality will immediately undo the cleaning. This leads to:
- Wasted water and labor
- Increased operational costs
- Inefficient sustainability practices

---

## 💡 Solution
PollenGuard dynamically evaluates local pollen (PM10) and air quality data to determine whether fleets should:
- **WASH ALL**
- **LIMITED WASH**
- **HOLD WASH**

An integrated AI explanation layer translates environmental data into clear, non-technical reasoning for managers and stakeholders.

## 🔍 Key Features
- 🌍 **Location-based search** (city, address, or ZIP code)
- 📡 **Live air quality & pollen data** via Open-Meteo API
- 🤖 **AI-generated decision explanations** using Google Gemini
- 🗺️ **Interactive fleet map visualization**
- 📋 **Actionable fleet-level wash recommendations**
- 💧 **Estimated water savings calculation**
- ⚠️ **High pollen simulation mode** for demos

## 🧠 Decision Logic
| Condition | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Low pollen (PM10 ≤ 20) | ✅ Wash all vehicles |
| Moderate pollen (20 < PM10 < 40) | ⚠️ Limited wash |
| High pollen (PM10 ≥ 40) | ❌ Hold wash |
